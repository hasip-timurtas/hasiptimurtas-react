          Currently thriving as a Development Manager in Spain, my journey in tech began at 16, crafting my first significant program—a damage calculation tool. This early passion led me from a hobbyist to a professional, with an education from Karabuk University and a career path that has taken me from a full-stack developer to leadership roles. I thrive on building sophisticated web applications, constantly pushing the envelope with new technologies to create faster, more efficient, and user-friendly solutions. <br />
          In my latest roles:
          <br />•    As a <strong>Lead Developer</strong>, I led a multicultural team of 8, honing our craft in game development, improving our workflow, and ensuring product excellence by integrating with QA and product teams.
          <br />•    Moving up to <strong> Development Manager</strong>, I oversaw 4 teams, implementing a new software architecture with modern technologies such as NestJS, TypeScript, and Docker, amongst others, to elevate our development practices.
          <br />I'm particularly passionate about Javascript—its ubiquity powers my drive to innovate. Beyond the code, I enjoy coffee, Linux, and chess, reflecting my love for strategy, both on and off the board. I'm a self-taught learner, continually upgrading my skills through platforms like Udemy, TeamTreeHouse, and YouTube.
          <br />Skills and Experiences:
          <br />•    Deep expertise in Javascript, both standalone and with frameworks like NodeJS, ReactJS, VueJS, Angular, and Typescript.
          <br />•    Proficient in full-stack development, familiar with both front-end and server-side languages and technologies.
          <br />•    Skilled in modern software development practices, including MVC, OOP, design patterns, and microservices architecture.
          <br />•     Experienced with Git & GitHub, Linux, Docker, and cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Firebase.
          <br />•    Background knowledge in Nodejs, C#, Python, and PHP.
          <br /> I'm driven by the challenge of building new things and exploring the latest technologies, always looking for ways to improve and streamline development processes.
