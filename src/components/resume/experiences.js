                        Asp.Net MVC, Entity Framework and created websites. I created 3 corporate website templates then I was editing the design of this
                        templates for selling. While I was working there, the company sold more than 10 websites. Line Software was a good company for me it gave
                        me a level of independence, that helped me to develop myself as a full stack developer.
